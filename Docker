Docker container vs Docker Image
Explanation with an example:

Consider you have a game (iso) image in your computer.

When you run (mount your image as a virtual drive), a virtual drive is created with all the game contents in the virtual drive and the game installation file is automatically launched. [Running your docker image - creating a container and then starting it.]

But when you stop (similar to docker stop) it, the virtual drive still exists but stopping all the processes. [As the container exists till it is not deleted]

And when you do start (similar to docker start), from the virtual drive the games files start its execution. [starting the existing container]

In this example - The game image is your Docker image and virtual drive is your container.

*********************
Docker run the image in detach mode with port:
 docker run -d -p 8080:8080 [imageId]
 
 Docker execute the container and edit:
 docker exec -it [containerId] sh
 Note that exec command works only on already running container. If the container is currently stopped, you need to first run it.
