@SessionAttributes annotation is used to store the model attribute in the session. This annotation is used at controller class level.

@SessionAttributes("user")
public class LoginController {

	@ModelAttribute("user")
	public User setUpUserForm() {
		return new User();
	}
}
In the above code snippet, the model attribute ‘user’ will be added to the session if the name attribute of the @ModelAttribute and @SessionAttributes annotations is same.
 
@SessionAttribute annotation is used to retrieve the existing attribute from session that is managed globally and it is used at method parameter as shown follows.

@GetMapping("/info")
public String userInfo(@SessionAttribute("user") User user) {
	//...
	//...
	return "user";
}


Actuator vs Spring Boot Admin Server
1. Actuators are great at inspecting individual Spring Boot applications, but when you have ‘n’ number of Spring Boot Services, the actuators are not easy.
2. The Admin Server, exactly solves this problem. it is a server which provides UI based management and monitoring console for various Spring Boot Applications.


SpringBootServletInitializer is an extension of WebApplicationInitializer which runs a SpringApplication from a traditional WAR archive deployed on a web container. This class binds Servlet, Filter and ServletContextInitializer beans from the application context to the server.

Grace Shutdown:
Let’s consider this scenario — there’s an application that has a long blocking process. Along with that, this app needs to be shut down and replaced with a newer version. Wouldn't it be nice if, instead of killing all the connections, it just gracefully waited to finish before the shutdown?
